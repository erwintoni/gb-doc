\Chapter{Project Implementation}

The GradeBadge application is designed to work on mobile devices and desktop computers. The UI of the application is developed using Bootstrap. When a page requires the data to be loaded from server or modified or deleted, a request is sent to the Web server over  HTTPS. The requests are sent to the Web server using Ajax. For handling Ajax requests and responses, this application uses JQuery Ajax API. All UI components are dynamically created or initialized in response to the data received from the Web server.

\section{Login Screen}
GradeBadge uses Facebook account for users to login. When the user is not logged-in to Facebook, the screen is automatically redirected to the Facebook login screen as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:login_screen}. Every user in the system can be badge issuer and badge earner.
