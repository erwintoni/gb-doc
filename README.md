masters_latex_template
======================

A Latex template to produce master's degree reports and theses for CSUSB.

This is a sample master's project report that I first developed
from Birdy Wang's master's project.
Birdy's project report was developed using Dr. Keith Schubert's style package
and web site instructions.

Chris Ballinger used this template and provided additional changes 
to Dr. Schubert's style package `sbthesis.cls`.

I used Miktex to build this project.
I didn't need to use \FixBib as explained in `main.tex`.
If you have trouble getting the page number to appear
on the first page of the bibliography, then try to use \FixBib as described in a comment
somewhere in the source.

To build a pdf from the source files, run `build.bat`.

To delete intermediate files, run `clean.bat`.
