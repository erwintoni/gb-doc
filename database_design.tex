\section{Overview}
\subsection{MongoDB}
MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, open source, NoSQL document-based database. MongoDB provides a document-oriented storage paradigm, including indexes for fast queries, replication for increased reliability, and auto-sharding for scalability \cite{mongodb}.

\subsection{MongoLab}
MongoLab is a cloud computing provider for the MongoDB database that was used in this project \cite{mongolab}.  MongoLab has a free tier service, which was used for the purposes of this project.

\subsection{Documents}
Data in MongoDB is stored in documents.  Every document must have a primary key named {\_id} and reside in a document collection. Compared to SQL databases, documents in a collection are like rows in a table.  Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB documents don't adhere to a schema, other than the requirement they have a {\_id} field that serves as a primary key.  When creating a new document, if you don't specify an {\_id} field, mongoDB will add it automatically \cite{mongodb}.

Although document structure is not enforced in MongoDB, different data models and structure may have significant impacts on MongoDB and application performance. So it is good to keep some kind of structure or pattern in the data model \cite{mongodb}.

\subsection{Collections}
Documents in MongoDB are organized into collections, and basic database operations are performed relative to collections. Indexes can be assigned to any field or subfield contained in documents within a MongoDB collection; they are defined on a per-collection level. Indices are need to perform queries that run faster than linear time.  \cite{mongodb}   

\section{Data Model}
In this project, there are three main collections: User, Group and Badge.  There are four linking collections to represent the many-to-many relationships between the main collections that are needed by the application.  These collections are described in the following, and shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:db}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item user: This collection contains the user information.
\item group: This collection contains the group information.  
\item badge: This collection contains the badge information.
\item group{\_}admin{\_}links: This linking collection contains pairs of group ids and user ids, which represent the many-to-many relationships between groups and their admins.
\item group{\_}member{\_}links: This linking collection contains pairs of group ids and user ids, which represent the many-to-many relationships between groups and their members.
\item badge{\_}user{\_}links: This linking collection contains pairs of badge ids and user ids, which represent the many-to-many relationship between badges and their earners.
\item group{\_}badge{\_}links: This linking collection contains pairs of group ids and badge ids, which represent the many-to-many relationships between groups and their badges.
\end{itemize}
