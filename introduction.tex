\Chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

A long time ago, businesses used to produce their own electric power. And due to engineering breakthrough in electric generator and transmission method, it became easier to produce and transmit electricity, to supply businesses that once produced their own electricity. As more businesses started buying electric power, making utility expanded and electricity cheaper. 

And today, just like the utilities, instead of buying servers to run your websites or applications, you rent servers or server spaces from cloud computing providers. Just like renting an apartment, even you are in the same building with other people, you still have your own space. As more people rent and buy computing power, making clould computing expanded and very popular. 

Today there are many cloud computing providers and they are providing different type of services. Some may provide hosting, database, code repositories or storage or combinations. Few famous providers are Google App Engine, Windows Azure, Amazon Web Services and Heroku. 

Google App Engine provides infrastructure to build the web application on the same scalable systems that power Google applications which support Phyton, Java, PHP and Go programming language. Google App Engine also provides several options for storing data, using App Engine Datastore, Google Cloud SQL, and Google Could Storage. Windows Azure provides similar service as Google App Engine but supports different set of programming language, such as .Net, Java, Node.js and Phyton.

Amazon provides scalable cloud computing, which allow users to choose what type of operating system and configuration of the servers they need, but it can scale as needed. It is more flexible to use any technologies, but require a lot of time and expertise to set it up. 

In this project, Heroku is used to as cloup application platform which support Node.js, Ruby, Clojure, Java, Phyton and Scala. Heroku lets you use and publish an application that people can use right away with no cost and obligation, and you can take advantage of the same scalable technologies that Facebook applications are built on, and the reliability, performance and security.

Among all the programming language supported in Heroku, in this project, Node.js is used as main programming language in the server side. HTML5, Javascript, Jquery and Bootstap framework will be used in the client side. 

As data store provider, MongoLab is used which support MongoDB database. MongoDB is NOSQL, document-oriented database, and has become very popular.   

Node.js and MongoDB in Heroku is     

The following describe the clould computing service providers used in this project. Heroku, MongoLab, and GitHub.

\section{Facebook}
Facebook has billions of users and very popular. It has proven to be good platrom to use for web application and take advantage of its social networking, to connect to other Facebook users..... 

\section{Heroku}
Cloud computing is a model which makes use of computer hardware and software that are accessed through the Internet as services. There are several choices of cloud computing services available, but for this project we choose the one provided by Heroku, the cloud computing partner of Facebook. \cite{Heroku}.

The reasons are that Heroku lets you use and publish an application that people can use right away with no cost and obligation, and you can take advantage of the same scalable technologies that Facebook applications are built on, and attain a similar level of reliability, performance and security. 

\section{MongoDB}
There are many different types of cloud-based datastore services to choose from. For this project we will use MongoDB, as it works well Node.js and Heroku. MongoDB is a scalable, high-performance, open source, NoSQL document-based database. MongoDB features include document-oriented storage, indexes, replication, high availability, auto-sharding, and querying.

\section{MongoLab}
MongoLab is the cloud computing provider for MongoDB, easily integrated with Heroku

\section{Git}
Git is a distributed version control system.  This project uses git with GitHub, a cloud-based provider of remote git repository storage.  Heroku uses git as a means to deploy web applications to its servers. Git allows easy creation of testing, staging, and production versions of the application. 

\section{Bootstrap}
Bootstrap by Twitter provides responsive design framework that work well for application to be used in desktop, tablet and mobile phone.

\section{Jquery}
Jquery is used for AJAX and DOM manipulation.

\section{Node.js}
Cloud-based services support apps written in several different programming languages, such as Java, Python, PHP, Javascript, Ruby and many more. For this project we would use Javascript running in a Node.js context. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

\section{Purpose}
To explore the new technologies, to create cross-platform reward application that individual can use.

\section{Project Scope}
Project does not include database sharding features to allow greater degree of scalability. 

The GradeBadge application provides the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create group
\item Create Badge 
\item Add Member
\item Issue Badges to Members
\item View Badge Earned
\item Share Badge to Social Networking 
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
Explain manoj work and explain the differences, Google App Engine VS Heroku, Google Data Store VS MongoLab, Java VS Node.js, Jquery Mobile VS Bootstrap. \cite{Manoj}

\section{Project Limitations}
Users must have Facebook account,  logged in to facebook and authorized access to basic information (name, profile picture and friend list) .For best experience must use modern browser in either PC or tablet or smart phone.
